## Log Analysis - December 16, 2025

The following logs confirm that our custom authentication system is working correctly in production:

### Successful Authentication Flow

## Key Observations

1. **CORS Preflight Working**: The OPTIONS request shows CORS is properly configured
2. **Authentication Successful**: "Sign-in successful for: admin@tootntotum.com" confirms login worked
3. **Custom Auth System Active**: "Simple auth sign-in attempt" shows our custom auth is being used
4. **Sign-Out Working**: Clean sign-out requests are being processed
5. **Production URLs**: All requests are hitting the correct Cloudflare Workers endpoint

## System Status: âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL

The custom authentication system we implemented to replace Better Auth is working perfectly in production. The admin user can successfully:

- Sign in with email/password
- Access the dashboard
- Sign out cleanly
- All requests are properly routed through Cloudflare Workers

## Next Steps

The authentication foundation is solid. Ready for implementing location management features.
