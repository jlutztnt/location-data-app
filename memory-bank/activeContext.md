# Active Context

## Current Focus
âœ… **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT & CLEANUP COMPLETE!** The migration from Better Auth to the custom `SimpleAuth` system is finished, and the application has been successfully deployed to production. The next phase is to begin implementing the location data management features on the stable, production-ready platform.

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### ðŸŽ‰ **Successful Migration to `SimpleAuth`**
- âœ… **Complete Better Auth Removal**: Uninstalled `better-auth` and all related dependencies from both frontend and backend.
- âœ… **Custom Auth Implementation**: Created and integrated the `SimpleAuth` class, which uses the Web Crypto API for secure, session-based authentication.
- âœ… **File Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete Better Auth files and updated all imports to use the new `SimpleAuth` system.
- âœ… **User Creation**: The new `create-admin-simple.ts` script is working correctly.

### ðŸš€ **Production Deployment**
- âœ… **Cloudflare Worker**: The backend API is deployed and live at `https://location-data-api.jlutz.workers.dev/`.
- âœ… **Vercel Frontend**: The Next.js frontend is deployed and live at `https://location-data-app.vercel.app`.
- âœ… **Git Repository**: All cleanup and migration changes have been committed with descriptive messages.
- âœ… **User Confirmation**: The user has confirmed that the deployed application "it works."

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**
- **Backend**: Hono framework on Cloudflare Workers with the custom `SimpleAuth` middleware.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with a custom React auth client (`auth-client.ts`).
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with a clean schema (no more Better Auth tables).
- **Security**: Admin-only user creation, SHA-256 password hashing, and secure session management.
- **CORS**: Properly configured for production domains.

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### **Authentication Architecture**
- **`SimpleAuth`**: Migrated from Better Auth to a lightweight, custom solution to resolve Cloudflare Workers compatibility issues and reduce dependencies.
- **Admin-Only Creation**: Public sign-up remains disabled for security.
- **Session Management**: Secure, cookie-based sessions handled by the custom implementation.

### **Database Design**
- **Simplified Schema**: Removed the `account` and `verification` tables, as they are no longer needed. The schema now only includes `user`, `session`, and the application-specific tables.
- **Location Tables**: `locations`, `districts`, `managers`, `store_hours` with proper relations.
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle ORM with push-based migrations for D1.

### **API Architecture**
- **Hono Framework**: Clean, Express-like routing for Cloudflare Workers
- **Route Structure**: `/api/*` for protected routes, `/public/*` for open access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **CORS Middleware**: Proper cross-origin configuration

## Current System Status
- ðŸŸ¢ **Production Backend**: Deployed and operational at `https://location-data-api.jlutz.workers.dev/`.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Production Frontend**: Deployed and operational at `https://location-data-app.vercel.app`.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Authentication**: Custom `SimpleAuth` system is fully functional in production.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Database**: Cloudflare D1 is online and contains production data.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Git**: Repository is clean and up-to-date.

## Next Steps (Location Data Features)

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Location Management**: Implement CRUD operations for store locations
2. **Data Import**: CSV import functionality for bulk location data
3. **Google My Business Integration**: Sync store information with GMB
4. **API Endpoints**: Public API for location data access
5. **Store Hours Management**: Dynamic hours with holiday schedules

### **Technical Implementation Plan**
1. **Database Seeding**: Add sample location data for testing
2. **API Routes**: Implement protected CRUD endpoints for locations
3. **Frontend Forms**: Create location management UI components
4. **Data Validation**: Implement proper validation for location data
5. **Public API**: Create public endpoints for external consumption

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout the application
- **Component Architecture**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Security First**: All admin operations require authentication
- **Clean Code**: Well-documented, maintainable code patterns

## Learnings and Project Insights

### **Authentication Complexity Solved**
- Better Auth significantly simplified the authentication implementation
- Hono framework made Cloudflare Workers development much more pleasant
- Proper CORS configuration was critical for cross-origin authentication
- SQLite compatibility required specific Drizzle adapter configuration

### **Development Workflow**
- PowerShell compatibility requires semicolon (`;`) instead of `&&` for command chaining
- Cloudflare D1 migrations work best with Drizzle's push-based approach
- Better Auth's `trustedOrigins` configuration is essential for local development
- Session management "just works" once properly configured

### **User Experience Focus**
- Clean, professional UI builds trust for admin users
- Clear system status indicators provide confidence
- Proper loading states and error handling improve usability
- Admin-only access ensures security while maintaining ease of use

## Files Created/Modified in `SimpleAuth` Migration

### **Backend Files**
- `backend/src/lib/simple-auth.ts` - The core custom authentication logic.
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Hono app updated with `SimpleAuth` routes and middleware.
- `backend/src/db/schema.ts` - Schema simplified after Better Auth removal.
- `backend/scripts/create-admin-simple.ts` - New admin user creation script.
- `backend/wrangler.toml` - Updated with production environment details.

### **Frontend Files**
