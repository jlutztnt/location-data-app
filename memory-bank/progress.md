- âœ… **Dashboard Protection**: Protected routes are enforced by `SimpleAuth` middleware.

### **Technical Infrastructure (COMPLETE & DEPLOYED)**
- âœ… **Project Scaffolding**: Stable frontend and backend architecture.
- âœ… **Database Schema**: Simplified schema (no Better Auth tables) is live in Cloudflare D1.
- âœ… **Hono Framework**: Clean API routing with proper error handling
- âœ… **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- âœ… **Development Environment**: Local development servers running and tested

### **User Interface (COMPLETE)**
- âœ… **Login Page**: Professional authentication form
- âœ… **Admin Dashboard**: Beautiful interface with 6 management sections
- âœ… **System Status**: Real-time monitoring of database, API, and auth status
- âœ… **Authentication Flow**: Complete login â†’ dashboard â†’ sign out cycle

## What's Left to Build

### **Phase 2: Core Data Management (NEXT PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Location CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete store locations
- [ ] **Location Management UI**: Forms and tables for managing store data
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Proper validation for location information
- [ ] **Store Hours Management**: Dynamic hours with holiday schedules
- [ ] **Districts Management**: Organize stores by districts and regions

### **Phase 3: Data Integration**
- [ ] **CSV Import System**: Bulk import functionality for location data
- [ ] **Google My Business Integration**: Sync store information with GMB
- [ ] **Public API Endpoints**: External API for location data access
- [ ] **Data Synchronization**: Automated sync processes

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Manager Assignment**: Store manager information and assignments
- [ ] **API Key Management**: Secure API access for external systems
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track all admin actions and changes
- [ ] **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for users

### **Phase 5: Production Deployment**
### **Phase 5: Production Deployment (COMPLETE)**
- âœ… **Vercel Frontend Deployment**: Deployed at `https://location-data-app.vercel.app`.
- âœ… **Cloudflare Workers Production**: Deployed at `https://location-data-api.jlutz.workers.dev/`.
- âœ… **Environment Configuration**: Production secrets and variables are configured.
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerts**: Production monitoring and error tracking (future task).

## Technical Accomplishments

### **Database Architecture**
- **Simplified Schema**: The database schema has been cleaned up, removing tables specific to Better Auth (`account`, `verification`).
- **Location Tables**: The core application tables (`locations`, `districts`, `managers`, `store_hours`) are in place.
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle ORM with push-based migrations remains the standard for D1.

### **Authentication Security**
- **Custom Implementation**: Security is now handled by the `SimpleAuth` class.
- **Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using the Web Crypto API (SHA-256).
- **Session Management**: Secure, cookie-based sessions are managed by the custom solution.
- **CORS Configuration**: Production-ready CORS is configured in Hono.

### **API Architecture**
- **Hono Framework**: Express-like routing for Cloudflare Workers
- **Route Structure**: `/api/*` for protected routes, `/public/*` for open access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## Known Issues & Blockers

### **Resolved Issues**
- âœ… **Better Auth Migration**: Successfully migrated to `SimpleAuth`, resolving dependency and compatibility issues.
- âœ… **PowerShell Compatibility**: Command chaining syntax is standardized.
- âœ… **CORS Configuration**: Production CORS is working correctly.
- âœ… **Session Management**: Custom session handling is stable.

### **Current Status**
- ðŸŸ¢ **No blocking issues**: System is fully functional and ready for next phase
- ðŸŸ¢ **Authentication working**: Complete login/logout flow tested
- ðŸŸ¢ **Development environment**: Both frontend and backend running smoothly

## Next Development Session Focus

**Priority 1: Location Data Management**
With the production infrastructure stable, the next focus is building the core features:
1.  **Location Management**: Implement CRUD operations for store locations.
2.  **Data Import**: Build the CSV import functionality.
3.  **Frontend UI**: Create the interfaces for managing locations in the dashboard.

The system is fully deployed and ready for the next phase of feature development.
